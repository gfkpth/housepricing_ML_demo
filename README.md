# Overview

This project investigates a dataset of housing data for Kings County, Seattle (<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/minasameh55/king-country-houses-aa>).
The goal is to predict sales prices based on the dataset in order to practice and experiment with supervised machine learning approaches.

All relevant steps of data preparation, model fitting and analysis are provided in the jupyter notebook <core.ipynb>.

The data can be downloaded at the source provided above, but given their small size will be made available in the data folder directly.
